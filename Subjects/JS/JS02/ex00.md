You need to create a function `setTimer` that receives a callback function `callback` and a time interval `interval` as parameters.

The callback function is executed taking a number `count` as a parameter, and returns true/false to determine whether to stop or continue the `setTimer`.`setTimer` must call the callback function before being stopped by callback at every interval after the input time interval.

> ðŸ’¡ Never call `callback` immediately after `setTimer` has run!

`setTimer` passes `count` as a parameter when calling `callback` function, which is incremented by 1 with each call. The initial value is 0.

The working example is as follows.

```javascript
import { setTimer } from './setTimerTimeout.js';

function printNum(count) {
	console.log(count);
	return count < 3;
}

setTimer(printNum, 100); // 0 1 2 3 <= Each output is 100ms apart.
```

You must create a `setTimer` function with the same name and parameters using the two functions `setTimeout` and `setInterval` respectively. Functions using `setTimeout` should be created in `setTimerTimeout.js`, and functions using `setInterval` should be created in `setTimerInterval.js`.
