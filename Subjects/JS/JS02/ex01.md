`Jean`, is a student at `42seoul`, recently started looking for part-time jobs to buy a new laptop.

He got a part-time job at a famous pretzel house!

`Jean` was assigned to make pretzels.

This operation will take the following sequence and time.
1. Make the dough       - 3 seconds
2. Primary fermentation - 5 seconds
3. Molding              - 4.2 seconds
4. Second fermentation  - 2 seconds
5. Fry                  - 5 seconds

Each task has a probability of failure, in this case you have to start the task again.

`Jean` is trying to implement `js` code that can do the above, help `Jean`!!!!

- Each task should be implemented using `setTimeout` function.
- The name of each step should be displayed using `console.log`. (At this point, the **failure content** should also be displayed.)
- Each task must be designed with a probability of failure by calling the function below each time.

  ```javascript
  function randomFail() {
    if (Math.random() < 0.2) throw "Production failed..!(The salary was cut ã…œã…œ)";
  }
  ```

- You cannot use `Promise`, `<Promise>.then()`, `<Promise>.catch()`, `async`, `await` keywords or functions.
