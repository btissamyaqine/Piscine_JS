|   Folder name to submit :     |  ex01            				 |
|   Filename to submit:			|  helloSomeone.js, package.json |
|   Available external modules: |  doesn't exist   				 |
|   Note :						|  doesn't exist				 |

Write a function that takes a parameter at execution time and prints a greeting `helloSomeone`. String, number, NaN, undefined, or null can be entered as parameters. Depending on which parameter, a function that behaves as follows should be implemented.

- If a string is entered as a parameter, "Hello `string`! should output If the string is an empty string, "Who are you?" output.
- If null is entered as a parameter, "I am null and void" should be output.
- If a number is entered as a parameter, it `number` should output "My age is ". However, if the number is negative or 0, "I am Benjamin Button!" prints out.
- If NaN is entered as a parameter, it should output "Age is just a number".
- If undefined is entered as a parameter, "Nobody can define me!" should output.

```javascript
// test.js
import helloSomeone from './helloSomeone.js'
helloSomeone("42");
helloSomeone("");
helloSomeone(null);
helloSomeone(42);
helloSomeone(-1);
helloSomeone(NaN);
helloSomeone(undefined);
```
